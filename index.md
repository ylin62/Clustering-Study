## Introduction

This project demonstrated the usage of clustering algorithm to automaticall extract racing battles from racecar telemetry data. The purpose is to automatically generate segment of interests from all available data and provided as datasets for detailed analysis. This eliminated the needs to manually select data segments and reduced data analysis efforts on out of interest data. The framework utilized a couple of hyperparameters which are interpretable with respect the racing battle definition, such as the distance between cars that are currently battling with each other.
